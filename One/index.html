            <h3>Nobel Man Of Bangladesh</h3>
            <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi economist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh. He studied economics and later became a professor, teaching at universities in Bangladesh and the United States. In 1976, he founded the Grameen Bank, pioneering the idea of microcredit — small loans given to poor people without collateral to help them start small businesses. His work transformed the lives of millions by promoting financial inclusion and empowering women. In 2006, Yunus and Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. He continues to advocate for social business and poverty alleviation.</p>
